# Product Requirements Document: Kubernetes Monitoring Stack

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive, self-contained observability platform for Kubernetes environments. The monitoring stack addresses critical visibility gaps in our Kubernetes infrastructure by providing unified metrics collection, log aggregation, and long-term data storage capabilities. The primary goal is to establish a centralized platform that enables proactive monitoring, faster incident resolution, and data-driven capacity planning.

## Goals

1. **Establish Centralized Observability**: Create a unified platform that consolidates metrics and logs from all Kubernetes workloads into a single, searchable interface
2. **Reduce Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: Achieve a 40% reduction in time from incident start to first actionable alert
3. **Improve Troubleshooting Efficiency**: Reduce developer troubleshooting time by 50% through correlated metrics-to-logs workflows
4. **Enable Proactive Monitoring**: Provide capacity planning capabilities using long-term metric retention (13 months)
5. **Accelerate Incident Resolution**: Achieve a 30% reduction in Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) through faster root cause analysis
6. **Ensure High Adoption**: Onboard 95% of production services within 6 months of launch

## User Stories

### Primary Maintainers (Platform & SRE Teams)
- **As a Platform Engineer**, I want to deploy and configure the monitoring stack using GitOps so that all components are version-controlled and reproducibly deployed
- **As an SRE**, I want to view aggregated cluster resource utilization trends over 12 months so that I can accurately forecast infrastructure capacity needs
- **As a Platform Team Member**, I want to define baseline alerting rules for common infrastructure issues so that all teams benefit from standardized monitoring

### Primary Consumers (DevOps & Application Developers)
- **As an Application Developer**, when I see a high 5xx error rate alert in Grafana, I want to click directly from the metrics dashboard to filtered logs from the exact time period so that I can immediately identify the root cause
- **As a DevOps Engineer**, when I deploy a new microservice, I want its metrics and logs to be automatically discovered and ingested so that I have immediate visibility without manual configuration
- **As a Developer**, I want to create custom alerts for my service by adding a PrometheusRule to my application's Git repository so that I can monitor service-specific SLIs without platform team intervention

2. The system must provide a native AlertManager interface for alert management
3. The system must support alert grouping and deduplication
4. The system must include comprehensive infrastructure alert rules out-of-the-box
5. The system must enable self-service alerting for application teams

2. The system must enable time-synchronized navigation between metrics and logs
3. The system must support filtering logs by specific pod/container when viewing metrics alerts
4. The system must maintain consistent labeling across metrics and logs for correlation

3. The system must handle node failures without data loss
4. The system must support multi-node deployments with load balancing

### FR-7: Data Retention and Compliance
1. The system must enforce automatic data retention policies:
   - Prometheus: 15 days raw metrics
   - Thanos: 13 months with downsampling (5m resolution for 120 days, 1h resolution for 1 year)
   - Loki: 90 days log retention
2. The system must implement PII scrubbing for log data to ensure GDPR compliance
3. The system must provide audit trails for configuration changes

### FR-8: Access Control and Security
1. The system must implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through Grafana
2. The system must restrict developer access to their own project data only
3. The system must use non-root containers with read-only filesystems where possible
4. The system must secure all communication with TLS encryption

### FR-9: Storage Management

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Components
The monitoring stack consists of the following core components:
- **Prometheus Stack**: Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, AlertManager, Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics
- **Long-term Storage**: Thanos Query, Store Gateway, Compactor, Ruler
- **Log Management**: Loki, Promtail
- **Object Storage**: MinIO for Thanos and Loki data
- **Visualization**: Grafana with integrated datasources
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Blackbox Exporter for endpoint health checks

### Data Flow
1. Promtail collects logs from all pods and ships to Loki
2. Prometheus scrapes metrics from discovered targets via ServiceMonitors
3. Thanos components provide long-term storage and global querying
4. Grafana provides unified interface with Prometheus and Loki datasources
5. AlertManager processes and routes alerts from Prometheus

### Resource Requirements
- **Minimum**: 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 300GB storage
- **Recommended**: 12+ CPU cores, 24GB+ RAM, 500GB+ storage

## Technical Considerations

### Deployment Method
- All components deployed via ArgoCD using GitOps principles
- Helm charts with custom values for configuration management
- Persistent storage using OpenEBS or equivalent CSI driver
- Gateway API for ingress and TLS termination

### Data Persistence
- All stateful components require persistent storage
- Automatic backup strategies for critical configuration data
- Storage expansion capabilities for growing data volumes

### Performance Optimization
- Prometheus recording rules for frequently queried metrics
- Thanos downsampling for efficient long-term storage
- Loki compression and indexing optimization
- Resource limits and requests for all components
