# Product Requirements Document: Kubernetes Monitoring Stack

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for **completing and optimizing** a comprehensive, self-contained observability platform for Kubernetes environments. The monitoring stack **foundation is already implemented** with Prometheus, Thanos, Loki, Grafana, and supporting components deployed via GitOps. This document focuses on the remaining work needed to achieve production-ready observability that meets enterprise requirements.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Already Implemented
- **GitOps Workflow**: ArgoCD ApplicationSet managing monitoring components
- **Core Prometheus Stack**: Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, AlertManager, Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics
- **Thanos Components**: Query, Store Gateway, Compactor (filesystem storage)
- **MinIO Object Storage**: Configured with thanos, loki, tempo buckets
- **Loki & Promtail**: Log aggregation from pods, events, system logs, kernel logs
- **Grafana**: Deployed with datasources and basic dashboards
- **Blackbox Exporter**: Synthetic monitoring capabilities
- **Security Contexts**: Non-root containers, security contexts configured
- **Persistent Storage**: Using Longhorn storage class
- **Network Policies**: Basic network security implemented

### ðŸ”§ Outstanding Requirements
- **Storage Optimization**: Increase allocations to meet retention requirements
- **Retention Policy Alignment**: Extend retention periods for compliance
- **S3 Integration**: Convert Thanos to use MinIO object storage
- **TLS Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption
- **PII Scrubbing**: Add log data protection mechanisms
- **Advanced Grafana Features**: Metrics-to-logs correlation, enhanced dashboards
- **High Availability**: Multi-replica configurations for critical components

## Goals

1. **Optimize Storage and Retention**: Align storage allocations and retention policies with enterprise requirements
2. **Complete S3 Integration**: Migrate Thanos from filesystem to MinIO object storage
3. **Implement Advanced Security**: Add TLS encryption and PII scrubbing capabilities
4. **Enhance Observability Workflows**: Enable seamless metrics-to-logs correlation
5. **Achieve High Availability**: Configure redundancy for critical monitoring components
6. **Ensure Compliance**: Meet 90-day log retention and 13-month metrics retention requirements

## User Stories

### Primary Maintainers (Platform & SRE Teams)
- **As a Platform Engineer**, I want to optimize the existing monitoring stack storage and retention to meet enterprise requirements without service disruption
- **As an SRE**, I want to migrate Thanos to S3 storage so that I can achieve true long-term metrics retention with automatic downsampling
- **As a Platform Team Member**, I want to implement TLS encryption across all monitoring components so that data in transit is protected

### Primary Consumers (DevOps & Application Developers)
- **As an Application Developer**, when I see a high 5xx error rate alert in Grafana, I want to click directly from the metrics dashboard to filtered logs from the exact time period so that I can immediately identify the root cause
- **As a DevOps Engineer**, I want the monitoring stack to automatically discover my service metrics and logs with 90-day retention so that I can troubleshoot issues that occurred weeks ago
- **As a Developer**, I want to create custom alerts for my service using the existing PrometheusRule workflow that's already implemented

## Updated Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Storage and Retention Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Prometheus**: Increase retention from 7d to 15d and storage from 25Gi to 50Gi
2. **Loki**: Extend retention from 7d to 90d to meet audit requirements
3. **Thanos**: Configure 13-month retention with proper downsampling (raw: 15d, 5m: 120d, 1h: 1y)
4. **MinIO**: Increase storage from 50Gi to 100Gi to support extended retention
5. **Storage Class**: Validate Longhorn vs OpenEBS performance for monitoring workloads

### FR-2: S3 Object Storage Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Thanos Components**: Migrate from filesystem to S3/MinIO object storage
2. **Objstore Configuration**: Update thanos-objstore-config secret with MinIO credentials
3. **Compactor Configuration**: Switch to S3 backend for downsampling operations
4. **Store Gateway**: Configure to read from S3 buckets instead of local storage

### FR-3: Security Enhancements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **TLS Encryption**: Implement TLS for Grafana, Prometheus, and inter-component communication
2. **PII Scrubbing**: Add log processing rules to identify and redact sensitive information
3. **Certificate Management**: Integrate with cert-manager for automated certificate lifecycle
4. **Access Control Validation**: Test and document the existing RBAC implementations

### FR-4: Advanced Grafana Workflows (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Metrics-to-Logs Correlation**: Configure seamless navigation between Prometheus and Loki data
2. **Enhanced Dashboards**: Add application-specific templates and correlation features
3. **Dashboard Provisioning**: Improve ConfigMap-based dashboard management
4. **Alerting Integration**: Enhance alert context with log correlation links

### FR-5: High Availability Implementation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Prometheus**: Configure multiple replicas with external labels
2. **AlertManager**: Implement clustering for high availability
3. **Grafana**: Enable multi-replica deployment with shared storage
4. **Load Balancing**: Ensure proper traffic distribution across replicas

### FR-6: Monitoring Stack Self-Monitoring (LOW PRIORITY)
1. **Component Health**: Enhance monitoring of monitoring stack components
2. **Performance Dashboards**: Create dashboards showing stack performance metrics
3. **Capacity Planning**: Implement alerts for storage and resource utilization
4. **Synthetic Checks**: Expand blackbox-exporter coverage for critical endpoints

## Non-Goals (Updated)

1. **Complete Redesign**: We will not rebuild the existing monitoring infrastructure
2. **Storage Class Migration**: Will not migrate from Longhorn unless performance issues are identified
3. **Distributed Tracing Enhancement**: Tempo is deployed but enhancement is out of scope
4. **External Integrations**: No chat, ticketing, or SSO integrations
5. **Multi-Cluster Management**: Focus remains on single-cluster optimization

## Updated Technical Considerations

### Current Architecture Strengths
- **Proven GitOps Deployment**: ArgoCD ApplicationSet working effectively
- **Comprehensive Log Collection**: Promtail collecting from all sources
- **Security Foundation**: Non-root containers and security contexts implemented
- **Monitoring Integration**: ServiceMonitors and metrics collection operational

### Required Optimizations
- **Storage Performance**: Monitor Longhorn performance under increased retention loads
- **Network Efficiency**: Ensure S3 communication doesn't impact cluster networking
- **Resource Scaling**: Adjust CPU/memory limits for extended retention workloads
- **Backup Strategy**: Implement backup procedures for critical configuration and data

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
1. **Storage Utilization**: Successful handling of 15-day Prometheus + 90-day Loki retention
2. **S3 Migration**: Zero-downtime migration of Thanos to object storage
3. **Query Performance**: Maintain <5s query response times with extended retention
4. **High Availability**: <30s failover times for critical monitoring components

### Operational Metrics
