# Task ID: 3
# Title: Deploy and Configure Thanos for Long-Term Metrics Storage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Deploy Thanos components (Query, Store Gateway, Compactor, Ruler). Configure 13-month long-term metrics storage with automatic downsampling, using MinIO for object storage.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up MinIO for object storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure MinIO as the object storage backend for Thanos
### Details:
Deploy MinIO in your environment, create the necessary buckets for Thanos data, and generate access credentials that will be used by Thanos components to interact with the object storage

## 2. Configure Thanos object storage secret [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a Kubernetes secret with MinIO connection details for Thanos components
### Details:
Create a configuration file with MinIO endpoint, access key, secret key, and bucket information. Convert this into a Kubernetes secret that will be referenced by all Thanos components

## 3. Deploy Prometheus with Thanos sidecar [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Set up Prometheus instances with Thanos sidecar for uploading metrics to object storage
### Details:
Deploy Prometheus with persistent storage and configure the Thanos sidecar to connect to the object storage. Ensure the sidecar has access to the object storage secret created earlier

## 4. Deploy core Thanos components [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Install Thanos Query, Store Gateway, and Compactor components
### Details:
Use Helm or direct manifests to deploy the Thanos Query (for querying metrics), Store Gateway (for accessing object storage data), and Compactor (for downsampling and retention). Configure them to use the object storage secret

## 5. Configure 13-month storage with downsampling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Set up retention policies and downsampling configuration for long-term storage
### Details:
Configure the Thanos Compactor with appropriate retention periods (13 months) and downsampling intervals (typically 5m to 1h and 1h to 1d) to optimize storage while maintaining query performance for older data

## 6. Deploy Thanos Ruler and set up monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Install Thanos Ruler component and configure monitoring for the Thanos deployment
### Details:
Deploy the Thanos Ruler component for evaluation of recording and alerting rules. Set up ServiceMonitors or similar resources to monitor the health and performance of all Thanos components
