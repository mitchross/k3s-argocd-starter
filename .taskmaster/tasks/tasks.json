This typically involves updating the `retention` or `retentionTime` setting for the Prometheus server.\n2.  **Adjust Storage Allocation:** Set the persistent volume claim (PVC) size for Prometheus to 20Gi to accommodate the extended retention while working within hardware constraints. This involves updating the `storageSpec` or similar configuration for the Prometheus statefulset.\n3.  **Optimize Resource Limits:** Review and adjust the CPU and memory resource requests and limits for the Prometheus server (and potentially related components like `kube-state-metrics` or `node-exporter` if their load is expected to increase significantly) to ensure stable operation with the increased data volume and retention period.\n4.  **Validate ServiceMonitor Auto-Discovery:** Confirm that ServiceMonitor auto-discovery is functioning as expected.
