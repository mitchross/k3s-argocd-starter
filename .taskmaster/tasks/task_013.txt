# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Security Measures and PII Scrubbing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Grafana RBAC, TLS encryption for all communications, non-root containers, and PII scrubbing for logs to ensure GDPR compliance.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Grafana RBAC [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Role-Based Access Control in Grafana to provide standardized access management for users and resources
### Details:
Configure RBAC settings in Grafana configuration files or environment variables. Set up permission validation, cache settings, and basic role resets. Create custom roles with specific permissions (actions and scopes) for different user types. Provision RBAC using YAML files for role assignments. Test access controls to verify proper permission enforcement.

## 2. Configure TLS encryption for all communications [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement end-to-end TLS encryption for all Grafana communications to ensure data security
### Details:
Generate or obtain TLS certificates from a trusted CA. Configure Grafana server to use HTTPS with proper certificate paths. Set up TLS for database connections, alerting channels, and other external communications. Implement certificate rotation procedures. Test TLS configuration with tools like OpenSSL to verify proper encryption and certificate validity.

## 3. Enforce non-root container execution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Grafana containers to run as non-root users to enhance security posture
### Details:
Modify Dockerfile or container configuration to use a dedicated non-root user. Set appropriate file permissions for Grafana directories and files. Configure volume mounts with proper ownership. Update security contexts in Kubernetes deployments if applicable. Test container startup and operation to ensure functionality without root privileges.

## 4. Implement PII scrubbing for logs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up mechanisms to identify and remove personally identifiable information from Grafana logs
### Details:
Identify potential PII data points in Grafana logs. Configure log processing pipelines with regex patterns to detect PII. Implement redaction or masking of sensitive information. Set up log rotation and retention policies. Test log scrubbing effectiveness with sample PII data to ensure proper removal.

## 5. Validate RBAC implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Test and verify that RBAC permissions are correctly enforced across all Grafana resources
### Details:
Create test users with different role assignments. Attempt to access various Grafana resources with each user type. Verify that permissions are correctly enforced for dashboards, data sources, alerts, and other resources. Document permission matrices and validation results. Make adjustments to RBAC configuration as needed based on testing results.

## 6. Conduct security audit and documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive security review and document all security implementations
### Details:
Review all security configurations including RBAC, TLS, container security, and PII handling. Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities. Document all security measures implemented with configuration details. Create runbooks for security incident response. Develop training materials for administrators on security features and best practices.
