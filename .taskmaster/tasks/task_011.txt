# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement High Availability and Scalability for Core Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure horizontal scaling and redundancy for critical components (Prometheus, AlertManager). Ensure system resilience to node failures and support for multi-node deployments.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up multiple Prometheus server instances [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure multiple identical Prometheus server instances with the same configuration to ensure high availability for monitoring and alerting.
### Details:
Deploy at least 2-3 Prometheus replicas on separate machines to satisfy availability requirements. Configure each instance with identical scraping targets and alerting rules. Add external replica labels to distinguish between replicas when communicating with external systems.

## 2. Configure Alertmanager clustering [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Set up multiple Alertmanager replicas in clustered mode to ensure high availability for alert routing, grouping, and throttling.
### Details:
Deploy multiple identical Alertmanager replicas that will use a gossip-based protocol to replicate information about sent notifications. Configure the cluster to maintain state consistency while prioritizing availability over strict consistency.

## 3. Configure Prometheus to use all Alertmanager replicas [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Update Prometheus configuration to send alerts to all Alertmanager replicas in the cluster.
### Details:
Modify the Prometheus configuration file to include all Alertmanager endpoints. This ensures alerts are sent to all replicas, allowing the Alertmanager cluster to deduplicate alerts based on their label sets and only send a single notification.

## 4. Implement workload distribution for horizontal scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Distribute the monitoring and alerting workload among replicas to achieve horizontal scalability.
### Details:
Choose appropriate fields to distribute workload among service replicas. For Cortex Alertmanager, implement a solution that can handle at least 10x the current capacity (scaling from 2000 to 20000 tenants) without increasing machine size.

## 5. Configure alert routing and team assignments [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Set up dynamic alert routing to ensure alerts are sent to the appropriate teams based on service ownership.
### Details:
Implement a system to associate alerts with specific teams. Use label-based routing in Alertmanager configuration to direct alerts to the right recipients. Create generic alerts that can be automatically routed based on namespace or other metadata.

## 6. Test failover scenarios and resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Verify the high availability setup by testing various failure scenarios to ensure resilience to node failures.
### Details:
Simulate crashes of individual Prometheus and Alertmanager instances to verify that the system continues to function without externally-visible downtime. Test scaling up, scaling down, and rolling out new versions without service interruption or data loss. Verify that alerts are still delivered when components fail.
