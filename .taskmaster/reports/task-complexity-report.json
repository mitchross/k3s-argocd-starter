      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of establishing a GitOps workflow with ArgoCD and deploying the core Prometheus stack (Operator, Prometheus, AlertManager, Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics). Include steps for ArgoCD installation, repository setup, application manifests, Prometheus Operator deployment, and validation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both setting up a GitOps workflow using ArgoCD and deploying a multi-component monitoring stack, each with its own configuration and dependencies.
